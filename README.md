# CENSEARCH

A census dataset searching tool. This version focuses on the ACS. It's an attempt to improve on the other search tools provided by the census or by census reporter. This relies on better text search queries, more intuitive display of results, and a more complete presentation of what datasets are available at what geographies, and for what publications.
